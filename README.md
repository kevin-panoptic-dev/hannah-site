# Personal Website for Hannah

This repository hosts the code for **Hannah's website** built with a **TypeScript React frontend** and a **Django REST framework backend**. It incorporates modern web development practices, smooth animations, and dynamic content rendering.

## üöÄ Features

### üåü Core Functionality

- **Stunning Spring and Parallax Effects Using react-spring-parallax:** Inspired by Apple, leverage the power of react-spring-parallax to create visually stunning spring and parallax effects. This library allows for smooth, physics-based animations and interactive scrolling experiences, providing users with a dynamic and engaging interface. Implement fluid transitions between elements, ensuring the animations are not just visually appealing but also enhance usability and navigation.

- **3D World with three.js and Texture Mapping:** Utilize three.js to craft immersive 3D environments that captivate users. Enhance realism with texture mapping, adding detailed surfaces to 3D models. This approach allows for the creation of interactive and visually compelling scenes, providing users with a deeply engaging and immersive experience. From simple models to complex worlds, three.js ensures robust and scalable 3D rendering.

- **Robust navbar Inspired by OpenAI Logic:** Design a modern and intuitive navbar based on OpenAI's user-friendly principles. This approach prioritizes seamless user experience, ensuring that navigation feels natural and responsive. By combining advanced logic with a clean aesthetic, the navbar enhances usability while maintaining a minimalist design.

- **Dynamic Data with No Frontend Hardcoding:** Eliminate hardcoded frontend data by fetching all content dynamically from the backend. This ensures that the user interface is always up-to-date, reflecting the latest changes and interactions. By decoupling the frontend and backend, this approach enables greater flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance. Dynamic rendering guarantees content updates in real-time, enhancing both user experience and operational efficiency.

- **AI-Powered Search and Feedback Analysis:** Leverage AI to analyze user feedback and enable intelligent search capabilities.
- **Multiple Login Options:**
  - Email + Password
  - Username + Password
  - Username + Email
- **Smooth Animations:** Create a polished, user-friendly experience with subtle, smooth animations.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Ensure content dynamically updates to reflect user interactions and backend data changes.
- **Markdown with Emojis and Responses:** Add rich content by supporting markdown input, including emojis and styled responses.
